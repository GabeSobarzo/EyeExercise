# EyeExercise
This is a simple application in which two eyes have a "pupil" that follow your mouse position on the screen.
# How to Run
Mouse events (click, move, leave, etc.) can help bind the Document Object Model (DOM) elements to events. This application only uses mouse movement to trigger an event -- the eyes following your mouse position on the screen.
