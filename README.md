# EyeExercise
This is a simple application in which two eyes have a "pupil" that follow your mouse position on the screen.
# How to Run
Mouse events (click, move, leave, etc.) can help bind Document Object Model (DOM) elements to events. This application only uses mouse movement to trigger an event -- the eyes following your mouse position on the screen.
# Roadmap of Future Improvements
To improve this application, a "blink" animation could be added upon clicking the mouse. An animation indicating the eyes are "dizzy" upon exceeding a certain movement threshold  could also be added. Customization options for eye color could be added as well in the future.
